/**
 * @example cloud/metadataConsole.php
 * The cloud service exposes meta data that can provide additional information about the various 
 * properties that might be returned.
 * This example shows how to access this data and display the values available.
 * 
 * A list of the properties will be displayed, along with some additional information about each
 * property. Note that this is the list of properties used by the supplied resource key, rather
 * than all properties that can be returned by the cloud service.
 * 
 * In addition, the evidence keys that are accepted by the service are listed. These are the 
 * keys that, when added to the evidence collection in flow data, could have some impact on the
 * result that is returned.
 * 
 * Bear in mind that this is a list of ALL evidence keys accepted by all products offered by the 
 * cloud. If you are only using a single product (for example - device detection) then not all
 * of these keys will be relevant.
 * 
 * This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-php/blob/main/examples/cloud/metadataConsole.php). 
 * 
 * @include{doc} example-require-resourcekey.txt
