/**
 * @example cloud/nativeModelLookupConsole.php
 *
 * This example shows how to use the 51Degrees Cloud service to lookup the details of a device
 * based on a given 'native model name'. Native model name is a string of characters that are
 * returned from a query to the device's OS.
 * There are different mechanisms to get native model names for
 * [Android devices](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build#MODEL) and
 * [iOS devices](https://gist.github.com/soapyigu/c99e1f45553070726f14c1bb0a54053b#file-machinename-swift)
 *
 * This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-php/blob/master/examples/cloud/nativeModelLookupConsole.php).
